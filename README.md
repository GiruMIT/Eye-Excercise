# Eyes
## Exercise on eyes

In this project, the black inner part of an eye will move following the movenet of your mouse. This image will rotate around its axis following your mouse. The code is built with structure f our eyes, the outer white and the inner black parts. Since we are using a round div, the eye will rotate around its own axis, making it appear to follow our mouse.
